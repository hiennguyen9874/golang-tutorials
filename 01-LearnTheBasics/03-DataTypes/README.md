# Data Types

- `bool`: zero value = false
- `string`: zero value = ""
- Numeric: zero value = 0
  - `int, int8/16/32/64`
  - `uint, uint8/16/32/64`
  - `uintptr`: This is an unsigned integer type that is large enough to hold any pointer address. Therefore is size and range are platform dependent.
  - `float32, float64`
  - `complex64, complex128`
- `byte`: alias for unit8, byte is used to represent the ASCII character
- `rune`: alias for int32, rune is used to represent all UNICODE characters which include every character that exists.
